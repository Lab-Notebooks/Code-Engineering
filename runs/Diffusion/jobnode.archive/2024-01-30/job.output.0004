System: Provide answers in FORTRAN

User: Write a subroutine to numerically compute variable coefficient diffusion term for a variable phi on a staggered finite difference mesh. Use coef as a variable to store those coefficients. Assume that phi is located on cell-centers, coef located on face-centers, and the result rhs located on cell-centers.
