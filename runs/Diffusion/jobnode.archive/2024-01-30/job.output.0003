System: Provide answers in FORTRAN

User: Write a subroutine for a variable coefficient diffusion term for a variable phi on a staggered finite difference mesh. Use coef as a variable to store those coefficients. Assume that phi is located on cell-centered grid, coef located on face-centered grid, and the result rhs located on cell-centered grid.
