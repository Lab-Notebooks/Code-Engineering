User: Write a subroutine to numerically compute diffusion term in x-y direction for a variable "phi" on a cell-centered grid. Assume constant coefficients and store the results in variable "rhs" which should be an input to the subroutine.

User: Write a subroutine to numerically compute variable coefficient diffusion term in x-y directions for a variable "phi" on a staggered finite difference mesh. Use "coeff" as a variable to store those coefficients. Assume that "phi" is located on cell-centers, "coeff" located on face-centers, and the result "rhs" located on cell-centers.
